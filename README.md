# Snowflake Geospatial Exercises

Welcome to the **Snowflake Geospatial Exercises** repository! 

This project was primarily a way for me to deepen my understanding of the various geospatial functions available in Snowflake. Additionally, it serves as a resource to help others learn and explore these capabilities.

## Project Overview

The exercises in this repository revolve around **Panucci's Pizza**, a fictional storefront. The goal is to solve a variety of geospatial problems that Panucci's Pizza might encounter in its operations. These problems include, but are not limited to:

- Determining delivery zones.
- Calculating distances between locations.
- Identifying the nearest store for a customer.
- Integrating external geospatial APIs for advanced functionality.

## Objectives

By working through this project, you will:

1. Gain hands-on experience with Snowflake's geospatial data types and functions.
2. Learn how to perform spatial queries and analyze geospatial data.
3. Understand how to integrate external APIs to enhance geospatial capabilities. *(Content to be added soon.)*
4. Develop problem-solving skills in the context of real-world geospatial challenges.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/SnowFlake_GeoSpatial.git
    ```
2. Set up your Snowflake environment and ensure you have the necessary permissions to work with geospatial data.
3. Follow the exercises provided in the repository to solve the geospatial problems.

## Prerequisites

- A Snowflake account with access to geospatial features.
- Basic understanding of SQL and geospatial concepts.
- Optional: Familiarity with external APIs for geospatial data.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store your Snowflake credentials securely. Below is an example of what the `.env` file should look like:

```env
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account_name
SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password

#Optional
SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=your_role 
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_warehouse
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=your_database
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=your_schema
```
